## §1 SUMMARY

Status: PARTIAL
Dispatch: VCC-BUILDANDDO-UPGRADE-001
Seat: BITS-CODEGEN
SRS: SRS-BUILDANDDO-UPGRADE-001
Branch: dd/bits/SRS-BUILDANDDO-UPGRADE-001-site-upgrades-20260914232924
Tasks: 21/45 acceptance gates complete; cumulative upgrades and workspace administration/community source
Smoke: 4/7 application gates; frontend/native/browser and private activation pending
CKS Gate: B+ (global minimum)
CKS: pending
CAPS: pending
CK: pending
Commits: 7 prior source revisions (8a1c407d12e830a041a454d3bc668f4d94e104c9, c84008b5b0a1630d8543006b7529a7da1d7badd9, 9b69cb79429f551dda5629a18bc025dce8ced29b, e820f8f220632405b910f9ebd9d71e2e20a00e41, af63ab4a64aa2708487e3a2f20b5c229e4da2d83, 203a08ced7348e551f810ed90b0a869b29532427, 858ccf52c82b58bdcd3b44db68b77e69c347d379); current evidence prepared before the administration source commit

The source now enforces current workspace membership and owner/admin boundaries,
provides audited settings and role management, and connects sink/extension,
Discord/Reddit requests to separate runtime observations. The wiki and forum
persist contributions with server-enforced publication, moderation and feature
settings. A browser cannot grant itself a role or assert an integration is healthy.

The baseline includes merged PR 23 and all previous site, mission, workflow,
business/learning and history work. Earlier delivery statements in prior reports
are historical. This source wave passes 144 Node and 18 Python tests, with 34
new Node cases. Required frontend dependencies and native PocketBase remain
unavailable. No current deployment or private executor is verified here.

Earlier phases retain their observed acceptance limits. The current implementation
and native/browser matrix are in docs/workspace-administration.md. Workspace
ownership is canonical; legacy membership labels do not mint owner authority.
RLS is enforced through PocketBase API rules and request policy, not PostgreSQL
or a restriction on trusted database administrators.

New control/community native writes are locked. Revision checks and actor-scoped
retry keys save each command and its audit atomically. Content remains scoped;
rendered wiki text cannot execute HTML. Configurations are closed non-secret
fields, and observations require dated matching receipts. The old service
status selector no longer fabricates a health-check timestamp.

## §3 SMOKE TEST RESULTS

| # | Command | Expected | Observed | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Targeted administration/community Vitest command below | Real UI interactions pass | Exit 127; vitest: not found | FAIL — environment |
| 2 | `npm --prefix apps/web run lint` | Official lint passes | Exit 2; missing eslint-plugin-import | FAIL — environment |
| 3 | `npm --prefix apps/web run build` | Production bundle emitted | Exit 1; spawnSync vite ENOENT | FAIL — environment |
| 4 | `node --test tests/upgrade/*.test.mjs` | Source regressions pass | 144/144 pass | PASS |
| 5 | `python -m unittest discover -s tests/upgrade -p 'test_*.py'` | Adapter/contrast regressions pass | 18/18 pass | PASS |
| 6 | `python scripts/ci/agent_context.py --check` | Measured context matches source | 28 frontend suites; six existing findings/four unwired gates | PASS |
| 7 | `python scripts/ci/verify_public_boundary.py` | Public paths/contents pass | 475 tracked files; zero failures | PASS |

```bash
npm --prefix apps/web test -- src/pages/workspace/__tests__/AdministrationFlow.test.jsx src/pages/workspace/__tests__/CommunityFlow.test.jsx src/hooks/__tests__/useWorkspaceControl.test.jsx src/__tests__/AppRoutes.test.jsx src/pages/workspace/__tests__/OperationsPage.test.jsx
npm --prefix apps/web run test:coverage
node .bits/out/VCC-BUILDANDDO-UPGRADE-001/check-source.cjs
python scripts/ci/supply_chain.py --skip-audit --check-lock --output /tmp/buildanddo-admin-supply.json
```

Coverage also exits 127 without Vitest. The lock audit exits 1 with eight missing
resolutions and two manifest dependency-group mismatches. Registry vulnerability
data is unknown because this check explicitly skips the unavailable audit.
No dependency removal, fabricated resolution or gate bypass was applied. Restore
declared dependencies and reconcile the existing lock on a registry-enabled
runner, then rerun the same frontend gates. Their root cause remains unresolved
in this environment. The limited checker passes 204 frontend modules with no
core/JSX binding errors; it does not replace lint, React execution or UI proof.

The Node suite exercises current-role denials, canonical owner protection,
foreign relation rejection, native-write constraints, replay/down and custom
schema preflight, stale revisions, lost responses and audit rollback. Connected
cases pass the real browser adapter to actual server policy with transactional
storage doubles and recover one membership grant, wiki page and topic per retry
identity. Incomplete backend response shapes fail explicitly before rendering.
The three new Vitest files cover actual screens/hooks and connected policy paths,
but their execution and 80% coverage thresholds remain unverified.

Selected production-source coverage:

```bash
node --test --experimental-test-coverage --test-coverage-include=apps/pocketbase/pb_hooks/workspace-access.js --test-coverage-include=apps/pocketbase/pb_hooks/workspace-administration.js --test-coverage-include=apps/pocketbase/pb_hooks/workspace-community.js --test-coverage-include=apps/pocketbase/pb_hooks/workspace-record-policy.js --test-coverage-include=apps/pocketbase/pb_hooks/administration.pb.js --test-coverage-include=apps/pocketbase/pb_migrations/1789900000_secure_workspace_rbac.js --test-coverage-include=apps/pocketbase/pb_migrations/1790000000_workspace_administration.js --test-coverage-include=apps/web/src/lib/workspaceControl.js tests/upgrade/*.test.mjs
```

Observed: 100% lines, 95.41% branches, 97.37% functions. These measurements concern
source exercised by Node, not native PocketBase/SQLite/JSVM behavior. The native
binary is absent. Isolated 0.28.4 API-rule, field API, transaction concurrency,
revocation, expansion, replay/down and rollback acceptance remains required.
Browser checks at 320/375/1280 px, both themes, keyboard/focus and account/workspace
changes remain unexecuted. docs/workspace-administration.md supplies the matrix.

## §4 MEMORY INGEST

Type A count: 188
Type B count: 353
Type C count: 32
IOO compliance: true
DKG orphans: 0
Payload: .bits/out/VCC-BUILDANDDO-UPGRADE-001/memory.json
Verify: `python .bits/out/VCC-BUILDANDDO-UPGRADE-001/verify.py`

All 28 earlier events are retained. Four new events record source reconciliation,
observed source tests, unavailable runtime checks and public governance/handoff
evidence with real timestamps. The baseline event references an actual source
revision; pre-commit test events use null commit_sha. Every file vector has a
declared relationship and current line count. Memory ingestion and CK signing
were not invoked; their values remain pending.

## §5 CKET FILING

06_PLAN: docs/workspace-administration.md and updated workspace-integration documentation.
04_HYPOTHESIZE: registered SRS continuation and existing registry notes.
07_BUILD: current-role policies, two migrations, authenticated commands, scoped browser client/hooks, admin/integration/wiki/forum pages and shared navigation/settings.
08_TEST: three new Node suites plus their storage fixture; three new frontend suites; route/operation test and coverage configuration updates.
11_COMMIT: dispatch, report/memory/context and community-controls/delivery handoffs.
13_SAVE: none.

The continuation adds 25 files. Paths follow the actual BuildAndDo AGENTS.md and
public path policy. CGRF provenance is present on 121/121 files new since the
original base, including existing JSON/PNG sibling metadata. Existing header
ownership/provenance is retained. REFLEX remains deferred to the private
post-merge validator. Run the memory verifier above for headers and edges.

## §6 GOVERNANCE

Entity: Citadel Nexus Inc. (Delaware C-Corporation)
License posture: unchanged; commercial contact licensing@citadel-nexus.com
Hard-NO scan: PASS; zero public-boundary failures
Secret scan: PASS; zero scanner failures
Stripe mode: not applicable; no checkout or payment-processing code added
Actor label: actor:agent required; not applied by this session
Risk / authority: A2 source/schema/access-policy work; no shared mutation or deployment

Workspace owners and administrators receive bounded app controls, not site-wide
superuser or private execution authority. New API collections remain locked;
credentials and external actions stay behind the existing private boundary.
No live seat event is fabricated because no authenticated live workspace was
supplied. No external message, token generation, private installer, production
write or deployment-control file is included. One registered umbrella SRS covers
the owner-authorized continuation; unrelated prior findings remain visible.

## §7 NEXT ACTIONS

Blockers: declared frontend packages and lock alignment; Vitest/coverage,
official lint and Vite build; native PocketBase 0.28.4 rules/JSVM/concurrency;
browser/mobile/theme/keyboard acceptance; actual private executor and delivery.

Handoffs requested: CMAX-B/IDE1 and the community operator through
.bits/handoffs/2026-09-15-bits-codegen-cmax-b-community-controls.md and the existing
BuildAndDo delivery note. These are local artifacts, not activated seats.
Suggested next dispatch: private acceptance and integration request/receipt
activation for the complete published source, followed by an authorized release
and served-version/flow verification. The receiving repository supplies its own
dispatch and authority. Bugs filed: none; no issue target or provider-write
capability is supplied. Six prior findings and four unwired gates remain open.

Rollback: retain stricter access rules and additive records for a frontend
rollback. Administration down retains settings, contributions and audit history
and removes the protocol marker to disable commands. RBAC down restores older
permissions and is an explicit compatibility rollback, not default recovery.
Coordinate policy/hook rollback with the private security owner; do not remove
hooks while permissive writes remain or down unrelated destructive migrations.
No shared rollback, release or private activation was performed here.
